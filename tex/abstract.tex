%Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) is a model-driven alternative to conventional reengineering processes that relies on the Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel (KDM) as the base for the whole process. Unlike conventional metamodels, KDM is capable of putting together different system abstractions (Code, Architecture, Business Rules, Data, Events) in an unique site and also retaining the dependencies among them. As it is known, central to modernization processes are the refactoring activities. However, most of existing model-based refactorings do not cope with propagation of the refactoring changes across other dependent abstraction levels, keeping all models synchronised. In this paper we present Propagation-Aware Refactorings (PARef), an approach for updating dependent models when specific elements are refactored. Our refactorings involve three main steps; the identification of all dependent elements, the refactoring of them and the propagation of changes in order to keep all the dependent models synchronised. We have conducted an evaluation that shows our refactorings reached good accuracy and completeness levels.

As it is known, central to modernization processes are the refactoring activities. However, most of existing model-based refactorings do not cope with propagation of the refactoring changes across other dependent abstraction levels, keeping all models desynchronized. In this paper we present a tool-supported KDM-specific approach for updating dependent models when specific elements are refactored. Our approach involve two main steps; the identification of all changed KDM model elements (dependent on the refactored ones) and the application of changes (propagation) in order to keep all the models synchronized. We have conducted two evaluation that shows our approach reached good accuracy and completeness levels.
