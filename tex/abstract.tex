%Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) is a model-driven alternative to conventional reengineering processes that relies on the Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel (KDM) as the base for the whole process. Unlike conventional metamodels, KDM is capable of putting together different system abstractions (Code, Architecture, Business Rules, Data, Events) in an unique site and also retaining the dependencies among them. As it is known, central to modernization processes are the refactoring activities. However, most of existing model-based refactorings do not cope with propagation of the refactoring changes across other dependent abstraction levels, keeping all models synchronised. In this paper we present Propagation-Aware Refactorings (PARef), an approach for updating dependent models when specific elements are refactored. Our refactorings involve three main steps; the identification of all dependent elements, the refactoring of them and the propagation of changes in order to keep all the dependent models synchronised. We have conducted an evaluation that shows our refactorings reached good accuracy and completeness levels.
Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) is a model-driven alternative to conventional reengineering processes that relies on the Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel (KDM) as the base for the whole process. Unlike conventional metamodels, KDM is capable of putting together different system views (Code, Architecture, Business Rules, Data, Events) in an unique site and also retaining the dependencies among them. During the system life cycle, artifacts tend to change, usually these changes entail refactorings. However, as a system can be represented by several different models, a common accident that arises during refactorings is to desynchronize (inconsistent views) the models. One solution is to apply Static Change Propagation (SCP) techniques. Most of existing SCP techniques deal with propagating changes in different and external models, usually from another vendor preventing or making difficult their application in other models, like KDM. Currently there is a lack of research concentrated on investigating SCP in KDM. In this paper we present a plug-in supported KDM-specific approach for updating dependent models/views when specific elements are refactored. Our approach involve three main steps: \textit{i}) identifying diff between the refactored KDM instance and the original KDM instance (the instance before one applies a KDM refactoring), \textit{ii}) the identification of all affected KDM model elements (dependent on the refactored ones), and \textit{iii}) the application of changes (propagation) in order to keep all the models/views synchronized. We have conducted two evaluation that shows our approach reached good accuracy and completeness levels.
