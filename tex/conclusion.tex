Theidea behind KDM is that the community starts to createparsers and tools that work exclusively over KDM instances;thus, every tool/algorithm that takes KDM as input can beconsidered platform and language-independent. For instance,a refactoring catalogue for KDM can be used for refactoringsystems implemented in any language~\cite{IRIDurelliCatalogo}.

The main contributions are: i) a DI Algorithm to identify all KDM model elements that need to be updated when a specific refactoring is performed, ii) a propagation technique approach, and (iii) a support and preliminary infrastructure for allowing the creation of refactorings for KDM without worrying about he propagation of changes.

 A possible future work is to integrate the proposed of Westfechtel \textit{et al}.~\cite{ICSOFT2014_Winetzhammer} with our presented approach.
