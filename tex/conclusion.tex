The main contributions are: i) a Java mining algorithm to identify all KDM model elements that need to be updated when a specific refactoring is performed, ii) a propagation technique approach, and (iii) a support and preliminary infrastructure for allowing the creation of refactorings for kdm without worrying about he propagation of changes.

 A possible future work is to integrate the proposed of Westfechtel \textit{et al}.~\cite{ICSOFT2014_Winetzhammer} with our presented approach.
