\section{Case Study}\label{sec:case_study}

In this section we present a case study showing that our approach can be used to support the change propagation in KDM models. We have used a real-life legacy information system. Some criteria were applied to select the suitable case, as follows: (i) it must be an enterprise system, (ii) it must be a Java-based system, and (iii) it must be a legacy system. After applying these criteria we have chosen LabSys (Laboratory System) that is currently used by Federal University of Tocantins (UFT) to control the use of laboratories in the entire university. 

The object of this study is the our proposed approach to propagate  changes, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the  effectiveness our approach. Taking into account the object and purpose of the study, it was defined one research question, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ$_1$}: Given a set of refactoring (\textit{Extract Class}, \textit{Move Class}, \textit{Extract Layer} and \textit{Remove Class}), can the proposed approach propagate all the changes effectively throughout KDM levels?
\end{itemize}

To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach through the \textbf{RQ$_1$}, we use some oracles. As each refactoring has its own characteristics and modifies specific model elements, it is possible to predict all the expected changes in other KDM levels. So, considering our set of developed refactorings, we had to develop some oracles for each refactoring. The complete oracle can be seen at www.mudar.com.br.

The execution of this case study was assisted by our Eclipse plug-in that we developed to support the proposed approach. As stated in Section~\ref{sec:the_approach} the proposed approach uses as input a KDM instance. Therefore, firstly we adopted a reverse engineering to  transform the LabSy source-code into a KDM instance to apply our approach. In this step we have used MoDisco\cite{Brunele20141012}, which is a framework that get as input java source-code and then return as output a KDM instance. Currently, MoDisco only generates the KDM \texttt{Code package}, other KDM packages are extremely important to evaluate our approach. Therefore, we manually instantiated the followings KDM packages: \texttt{Structure Package}, \texttt{Data Package}, and \texttt{Conceptual Package}. After applying LabSys to MoDisco we gathered a KDM instance that contains 29,444 number of model instances (in this context KDM meta-classes' instances in the model). More specifically LabSys has 144 ClassUnit's instances, 923 MethodUnit's instances, 31 Package's instances, 5 Layer's instances, etc. The memory used on hard drive disk after XMI serialization is 5.66 MB.


In order to carry out the case study we have selected three class-level refactorings (\textit{Extract Class}, \textit{Move Class} and \textit{Remove Class}) and one layer-level. The class-level refactorings are the conventional and well known Fowler's refactorings easily found on literature. The conceptual order of applying these refactorings are botton-up, i.e., from lower level elements to higher level ones. For example, when you move classes from one package to another, business rules representing those classes should also be moved to other scenarios.
        
However, in order to investigate top-down propagations we have also decided to apply the \textit{Extract Layer} refactoring. The goal of this refactoring is the extraction of responsibilities from one layer and the moving of them to a recently created one. In this case, the propagation is from top to down, because it is necessary to propagate changes to lower level elements, such as packages, for example. All refactorings were applied completely automatically by means of our devised proof-of-concept plug-in. To deal with refactorings that go into infinite loops, we set three minutes timeout interval. More specifically, we applied the \textit{Extract Class} to classes that had more than 300 LOC (Line of Code); we applied the \textit{Move Class} to a set of class from a package to another package; we applied the \textit{Extract Layer} to a layer that contains at least 20 classes; finally we applied the \textit{Remove Class} to a class that contained at least 15 primitive relationships. After applied all refactorings we verify whether them were successfully propagate throughout KDM levels, i.e., if the intended refactoring could be performed and if all the expected propagations were generated on the KDM model. 

Based on a set of oracle it was possible to verify if  all refactoring were successfully propagated throughout KDM models. Using these information gathered we can draw conclusion and answer the \textbf{RQ$_1$}. Table~\ref{tab:prop} summaries the results related to each refactoring applied and its respective propagations. In this table there are two abbreviations: (i) ``P.C?" (``Propagation Corrected?") and (ii) ``N.A" (``Not Applied"). In addition, this table also depicts the propagation regarding to the followings KDM packages: \texttt{Structure Package}, \texttt{Data Package}, and \texttt{Conceptual Package}. 

As can be seen all the changes were effectively propagated throughout KDM levels. Which means that in this case our approach could automatically execute truly relevant propagation in all KDM levels when dealing with the selected refactorings: \textit{Extract Class}, \textit{Move Class}, \textit{Extract Layer}, and \textit{Remove Class}. Observing globally the data in Table~\ref{tab:prop} we can argue that the use of our approach in the context of these refactorings has been satisfactory. The data also show that our approach it is able to propagate changes in KDM levels in an effective way and it also yields concise propagation of changes. Thereby, the \textbf{RQ$_1$} can be answered as true, that is, the proposed approach can propagate changes effectively throughout all KDM levels.
