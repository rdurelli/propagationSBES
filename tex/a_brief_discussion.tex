\section{A Brief Discussion}\label{sec:a_brief_discussion}

Notice that some propagations can also be considered as refactoring and vice versa. What characterize them is how they are used in a specific moment and not the implementation by itself. This is like having a set of refactoring that anyone can trigger anyone. When this is the case, the modernization engineer can directly apply both, unlikely propagations which clearly cannot be directly applied from the user, as it is shown in~\cite{ICSOFT2014_Winetzhammer}. This is generally the case for moving refactorings, as the moving of an element from a container to another is independent of both the container and their abstraction level. For example, suppose the existence of a class C1 belonging to a package P1. Consider also that C1 is the implementation of a business rule B1 which is inside a scenario S1 and that the package P1 is the implementation of the Scenario S1. So, C1 = B1 and P1 = S1. If the \textit{Move Class} refactoring is applied to transfer the class C1 to package P2, a natural propagation is to transfer the business rule B1 to another scenario. However, if the modernization engineer is using a modeling environment which provides a business rule view, (s)he could also have available for him(her) a moving business rule refactoring. In this case, the natural propagation would be to transfer the corresponding classes from one package to another. Therefore, we can see that in some cases there is bidirectional flow, which can be started from any point. 

The most important thing about this discussion is that this categorization lead us to make good designs in terms of refactorings and propagations. That is, for refactorings that fall in this category, it is very important to implement them as separated and decoupled modules which can be called directly from the user. So, all of our refactorings were implemented like that.
